This repository demonstrates the use of Terraform to fully manage a
python serverless function with a custom domain, and AWS managed
certificate.

There are many opportunities to improve and expand this (PR's welcome).

Tools needed for this:

 1. Terraform (macOS: `brew install terraform`)
 1. AWS cli (macOS: `brew install awscli`)
 1. Python 3.6

And, of course, an AWS subscription and credentials.
